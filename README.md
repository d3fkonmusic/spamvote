Working of this python script requires selenium installed.
Also, works better with Python 3.x

Chrome Driver also needs to be installed


INSTALL SELENIUM
$ pip install -U selenium

INSTALL CHROMEDRIVER
$ pip install -U chromedriver #install this to the working python directory

If the command pip isn't found, it can be executed from /python3.x_directory/scripts

Note:

This script is written to work for a specific client. This can be changed by changing the id in both the .py files.

'votecheck.py' compares the number of votes for 2 contestants. You can get the number of votes of the contestant you want by changing the ids. Also, the number of contestants to be compared can be changed by increasing the function calls made and by changing the output parameters.
